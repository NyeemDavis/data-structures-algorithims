Bruce force - simple and exhaustive technique that evaluates every possible outcome to fine the best solution
Ex: Linear Search

Greedy: Choose the best option at the current time, without any consideration for the future
Ex: Dijkstra's alogorithim, Prim's alogorithim, Kruskal's alogorithim

Divide and Conquer: Divide the problem into smaller sub-problems. Each sub-problem is then solved and the partial solutions are recombined to determine the overall solution
Ex: Binary Search, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Tower of Hanoi

Dyanmic Programming: Divide the problem into smaller sub problems. Break it down into smaller but overlapping sub problems. Store the result and reuse it for the same sub problems. THis is called memoization and is a optimization technique that improves the time complexity of your alogorithim
Ex: Fibonaci Sequence, Climbing Staircase

Backtracking: Generate all possible solutions. Check if the solution satisfies all the given constrains and only then you proceed with generating subsequent solutions. If the constraints are not satisfied, backtrack and go on a different path to find the solution.
Ex: N-Queens Problem
